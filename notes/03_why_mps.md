ED is a correct and fool proof method to find the ground state energy of a system but it fails when the system size is too large as it scales with 2^N and hence for large system it is not feasible to find the ground state energy. Also ED not the most creative method it is kind of a brute force method. As it treats the whole of hiblert space as equally important and then find the ground state energy. But as we observed from the porbability amplitude that there is a lot of structure in the state and it is not random. Therefore a subspace of hilbert space is sufficient to describe our system.
