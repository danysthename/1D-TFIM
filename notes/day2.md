: Ground State Energy Computation

**Ground State Energy Computation**

For a fixed system size N, we sweep the transverse field and compute the ground-state energy using sparse exact diagonalization. The ground-state wavefunction is stored at each field value to enable subsequent analysis of entanglement and correlations. The energy varies smoothly with $h$, with the most rapid changes near h= 1, signaling the finite-size precursor of the quantum critical point.
This is important becuase we want to show why further analysis is required and why analytic methods fail for higher value of N.(Due to curse of dimensionality).
As we increase h in order to plot it we observe that the energy of the system reduces which is obvious as -h is increasing.So dont obtain anything impressive from analysing energy we need to look into deeper to understand how changing h causes variation in the system. Hence we start analysing the gorund-state wavefunction obtained for a particualar value of h and look for pattern in probibilty amplitude values.  
We analysed probability amplitudes and ond observed that the probaility amplitude values approximately becomes equal pair-wise why this symmetry exists is not explainable.
But somehow local hamiltonian leads to global wavefunction so we try to look at how spaital division affects the system, and we need to measure how complex this system is so we need to study entanglement(atleast that what i understood so far).
